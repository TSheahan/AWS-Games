## 2026-03-05 — Bug fix: eula.txt and server.properties ownership

- `guarded_write_text` now accepts an `owner` parameter; when set, calls `chown <owner>:<owner>` after writing
- `update_server_properties` and `ensure_eula_accepted` pass `owner=EC2_USER` so both files are written as `ec2-user:ec2-user` rather than `root:root`
- Systemd unit files continue to be written without `owner`, preserving root ownership

## 2026-03-04 — Repo restructure, provisioning hardening, agentic readiness, and end-to-end validation

**Repo restructure**

- Moved all EC2-side scripts under `ec2/`, separating them cleanly from workstation tooling
  in `bin/`; `setup.sh` and `update-release.sh` relocated from repo root
- Documented the game extensibility model: `ec2/<game>/` as the dispatch mechanism for
  game-specific setup; a shared orchestration layer deliberately deferred until a second
  game type materialises

**Setup and provisioning refactor**

- Refactored `setup.sh`: removed `--server-folder` parameter; JAR placed at
  `/mnt/persist/minecraft/server_<version>.jar`; all server-specific setup delegated to
  `provision_servers.py --update --provision`
- Deleted `start-minecraft.sh` and `stop-minecraft.sh`; `provision_servers.py` generates
  per-server equivalents from config and is now the authoritative source of server
  configuration
- Aligned `TimeoutStopSec=90` throughout

**`reinstall_stack.py` safety and agentic readiness**

- Added `--execute` flag; without it the script is a dry run — safe by default
- Added `--yes` / `-y` to skip interactive confirmation prompts for non-interactive and
  agentic use
- Status and progress output routed to stderr via logger; structured output (YAML parameter
  summary) emitted to stdout — clean pipe-friendliness
- Fixed `GAME_EXISTING_VOLUME_ID` env var silently not wiring through to
  `--existing-volume-id` default

**AMI resolution**

- Replaced hard-coded AMI ID with an SSM dynamic reference in the CloudFormation template
  (`{{resolve:ssm:/aws/service/ami-amazon-linux-latest/al2023-ami-kernel-6.12-arm64}}`);
  each deploy resolves to the current security-patched build — no manual AMI ID maintenance required

**Provisioning hardening (driven by a live end-to-end provision run)**

- Replaced heuristic EBS device detection (size/type matching) with NVMe serial number
  matching against the known volume ID, with a root-exclusion fallback
- Fixed new-volume path: `reinstall_stack.py` now always resolves and passes the AZ
  explicitly, eliminating a potential CloudFormation dependency loop on `NewVolume`
- Quieted `yum` and `wget` output (`-q`) to reduce UserData log noise

## 2026-03-03 — CLAUDE.md context architecture and documentation enrichment

- Created `CLAUDE.md` hierarchy at repo root, `bin/`, and `ec2/minecraft/` — project
  context, conventions, and architecture auto-loaded into every Claude Code session
- Enriched `README.md` with integrated automation narrative, provisioning chain diagram,
  design decisions table, and per-component breakdown

---

## 2026-01-19 — Server status tooling

- Added `mcstatus.sh`: one-shot status display of all `minecraft-*.service` systemd units

---

## 2026-01-17 — Multi-server provisioning engine

- Introduced `provision_servers.py`: reads `minecraft-servers.yaml` from a private config
  repo and generates per-server systemd units, start/stop scripts, and `server.properties`
- Mode separation: `--update` (pull config), `--read-only` (validate only), `--provision`
  (full write); independently composable
- Port configuration sourced from `/home/ec2-user/game-ports.json` written by UserData
- Log written to `/var/log/minecraft-provision.log` (world-readable)
- Per-server enabled/disabled state tracking

---

## 2026-01-07 — EBS mount reliability

- Switched fstab entries to UUID-based identification, defending against block device order
  variation across instance reboots

---

## 2026-01-04 — First full dev release

Consolidated a working Minecraft server stack into a repeatable, parameterised deployment.

- CloudFormation template parameterised: `InstanceType` (default `t4g.medium`), game port
  range, Java package, setup command
- ARM64 / Graviton instance target established throughout
- `reinstall_stack.py`: full stack lifecycle tool — delete existing stack, create timestamped
  replacement (`GameStack-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`), wait for `CREATE_COMPLETE`, print outputs
- EBS volume provisioned with `DeletionPolicy: Retain`; world data survives stack deletion
- EBS reuse: `reinstall_stack.py` detects an existing volume and passes it through on
  redeploy; AZ alignment enforced to prevent attachment failures
- UserData waits up to 120 s for the EBS device to appear before formatting/mounting —
  handles the lag between CloudFormation attachment completion and kernel visibility
- NVMe device naming handled correctly in mount logic
- Open port range written to `/home/ec2-user/game-ports.json` for downstream scripts
- `update-release.sh`: convenience script for AL2023 release version upgrades
- Start/stop scripts updated: contemporary logging flag; IPv4 bind flag to prevent IPv6
  preemption on the listen port
- EULA check in server start script
- `requirements.txt` added (`boto3`, `pyyaml`, `botocore`)
- `README.md` added

---

## 2024-07-01 — Java 21 and Amazon Linux 2023 migration

- Upgraded from Amazon Linux 2 to Amazon Linux 2023
- Adopted Java 21 (Amazon Corretto); `java-package` parameter added to `setup.sh` to make
  JDK version configurable

---

## 2024-04-01 — Project inception

- CloudFormation template: EC2 instance, EBS volume, Elastic IP, Security Group
- UserData bootstrap: clone this repository onto the EC2 instance, execute a configurable
  `SetupCommand` parameter
- Initial `setup.sh`: installs JDK, downloads Minecraft server JAR
